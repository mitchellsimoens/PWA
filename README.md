# PWA

A demo of the Progressive Web App support in Ext JS 6.5 and Sencha Cmd 6.5.

## To run

You will need to download [Sencha Ext JS](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs). We
recommend extracting Ext JS into a `"sencha-sdks"` folder in your home directory.

Once Ext JS is extracted, run these commands:

    cd client
    sencha app install ~/sencha-sdks
    sencha app build
    cd ../server
    npm install
    npm start
